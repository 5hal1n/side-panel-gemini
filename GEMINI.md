# Project: side-panel-gemini

## Project Overview
This directory serves as the root for the `side-panel-gemini` project.
**Current Status:** The repository is currently empty (except for this documentation and git metadata). No code or specific framework configuration has been detected yet.

## Directory Structure
- `GEMINI.md`: Context and documentation for AI agents.
- `.git`: Git version control directory.

## Getting Started (TODO)
Since the project is empty, the immediate next steps usually involve scaffolding the application.

### Suggested Actions
1.  **Initialize Project:** Run framework initialization commands (e.g., `npm init`, `create-react-app`, `go mod init`, etc.) depending on the desired technology stack.
2.  **Update Documentation:** Update this `GEMINI.md` file once the project structure is established.

## Development Conventions
*No conventions established yet.*
