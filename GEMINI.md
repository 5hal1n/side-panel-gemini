# Project: side-panel-gemini

## Project Overview
This directory serves as the root for the `side-panel-gemini` project, which is a Chrome extension.
**Current Status:** The repository contains initial files for a Chrome extension.

## Directory Structure
- `GEMINI.md`: Context and documentation for AI agents.
- `.git`: Git version control directory.
- `src/`: Source code for the Chrome extension.
    - `background.js`: Background script for the extension.
    - `manifest.json`: Manifest file for the extension.
    - `rules.json`: Rules for the declarativeNetRequest API.
    - `sidepanel.html`: HTML for the side panel UI.
    - `_metadata/`: Metadata generated by the extension.
        - `generated_indexed_rulesets/`: Generated rulesets.
            - `_ruleset1`: Ruleset file.
    - `icons/`: Directory for extension icons.

## Getting Started (TODO)
The project has been initialized with basic Chrome extension files.

### Suggested Actions
1.  **Develop Extension Features:** Implement the desired functionality for the Chrome extension within the `src` directory.
2.  **Update Documentation:** Continue to update this `GEMINI.md` file as the project evolves and new conventions are established.

## Development Conventions

### Versioning & Release
- **Automated Workflow:** The release process is triggered by a slash command. When performing a release, the AI agent **must** ensure that a descriptive release note in Japanese is written in `RELEASE_BODY.md`.
    1.  **Analyze Changes:** Review commits since the last release tag to understand the scope of changes.
    2.  **Determine Version:** Select the appropriate Semantic Version increment (Major, Minor, or Patch) based on the analysis.
    3.  **Update Manifest:** Update the `version` field in `src/manifest.json`.
    4.  **Commit & Tag:** Commit the version bump and create a git tag (e.g., `v1.1.0`).
    5.  **Push:** Push the tag to the remote repository to trigger the GitHub Release workflow.

### Documentation Synchronization
- **README.md and README.en.md:** When `README.md` is updated, the AI agent must also update `README.en.md` to ensure content consistency. The agent is responsible for translating and verifying the changes manually.

### Git Workflow
- **Commit and Push:** After completing any task or making significant changes, the AI agent **must** commit the changes to the Git repository and push them to the remote.
    - **Commit Message:** Adhere strictly to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
        - Format: `<type>: <description>`
        - Common Types: `feat` (new feature), `fix` (bug fix), `docs` (documentation), `chore` (maintenance/tooling), `refactor` (code restructuring).
        - Example: `feat: Add option to customize side panel width`
    - **Frequency:** Commit regularly to maintain a clear history of changes.
