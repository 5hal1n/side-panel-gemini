## Project Overview
This directory serves as the root for the `side-panel-gemini` project, which is a Chrome extension.
**Current Status:** The repository contains initial files for a Chrome extension.

## Directory Structure
- `GEMINI.md`: Context and documentation for AI agents.
- `.git`: Git version control directory.
- `src/`: Source code for the Chrome extension.
    - `background.js`: Background script for the extension.
    - `manifest.json`: Manifest file for the extension.
    - `rules.json`: Rules for the declarativeNetRequest API.

## Getting Started (TODO)
The project has been initialized with basic Chrome extension files.

### Suggested Actions
1.  **Develop Extension Features:** Implement the desired functionality for the Chrome extension within the `src` directory.
2.  **Update Documentation:** Continue to update this `GEMINI.md` file as the project evolves and new conventions are established.

## Development Conventions

### Versioning & Release
- **Versioning:** When making changes (features, fixes), update the `version` field in `src/manifest.json` following Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
- **Tagging:** After updating the version, create a git tag in the format `v1.0.0` matching the manifest version.
- **Release:** Pushing a tag starting with `v` will trigger a GitHub Action to create a new Release and attach a zipped extension package.
